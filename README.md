## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available at:

- [**Reliance Industries Market Data (1994-2025)**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jatinkalra17/reliance-30-years-of-market-data19942025)
- **Description:** This dataset contains over 30 years of historical daily stock prices for Reliance Industries Limited. It includes 3,622 trading days (after preprocessing) with features such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. We utilized this raw data to engineer 13 technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.) to serve as input features for our predictive models.

## Usage
1. Open the Colab notebook linked above.
2. The dataset is automatically downloaded within the notebook. No manual download is required.
3. Run all cells (instructions are clear and accessible through markdowns and comments) to reproduce the results found in Table 2 (Model Performance) and Figure 6 (Feature Importance) of the report.
